# github-RAGchain

`github-RAGchain` is an innovative tool that utilizes a combination of technologies like LangChain, vector stores, OpenAI embeddings, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze and understand GitHub repositories. It provides users with a conversational AI interface to explore and extract insights from the content of any given GitHub repository, making it easier to comprehend complex codebases.

## Features

- Clone and process GitHub repositories directly through a web interface.
- Interact with the repository content using a conversational AI powered by OpenAI's language models.
- Navigate the repository's structure and contents with intuitive chat commands.
- Retrieve code explanations, file details, and other repository insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run `github-RAGchain`, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- Streamlit
- GitPython
- LangChain libraries

### Installation

First, clone the `github-RAGchain` repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-RAGchain.git
cd github-RAGchain
```

Next, install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.py` file at the root of the project with your OpenAI API key:

```python
# config.py
OPEN_AI_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
```

### Usage

Start the Streamlit app by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with `github-RAGchain`.

### How to Use

1. Input the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze.
2. The application will clone the repository and process its contents.
3. Ask questions in the chat interface to explore and understand the repository.
